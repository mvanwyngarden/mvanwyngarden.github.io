### Welcome!

Hi! I am a [Fulbright Student](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/fulbright-us-student-program) at the [Canadian Insitute for Theoretical Astrophysics](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. Under the supervision of Professor [Maya Fishbach](https://mayafishbach.me/), I study how to use gravitational waves to learn about cosmology. In particular, I’m working to improve methodologies in the “dark siren” method, a way of combining data from gravitational wave detections and galaxy catalogs to measure the local expansion rate of the Universe. I’m passionate about using data to answer cosmological questions, explore the early universe, and learn about large-scale structure.

I recently completed my Bachelor’s in Astronomy & Physics at Boston University. During my undergrad, my research spanned multiple topics and disciplines. I studied the pulsations of white dwarf stars observed by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. As an REU student at the [Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/graduate-undergraduate-programs/reu-summer-intern-program#:~:text=News-,Overview,full%20duration%20of%20the%20program/), I wrote software to test different formation and evolution mechanisms of small exoplanets. I even spent six months at CERN using machine learning to quantify the efficiency of proposed detector upgrades for ATLAS.
